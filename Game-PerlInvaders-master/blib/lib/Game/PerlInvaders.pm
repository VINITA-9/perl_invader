Game::PerlInvaders - space invaders game implemented using SDL

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # no usage atm

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A rather simple game of Space Invaders, implemented in a few hours in my Unix/Linux machine to get people interested in developing games 
using Perl and SDL.

Installation currently does not work, so you should run PerlInvaders 
in the project directory:
  
  perl -Ilib bin/perl_invaders.pl
